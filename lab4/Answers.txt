QUESTION 8)

Answer the following theoretical questions:
a) How can you protect the credit card information in the database from hackers?
b) Give three advantages of using stored procedures in the database (and thereby
execute them on the server) instead of writing the same functions in the f
ront-end of the system (in for example java-script on a web-page)?

a) The credit card information could for example be hashed it would make the
  information less vulnerable to hackers.
b) 1. Better performance since it allow the usage of the computing power at the
      server
   2. It is easier to use since it provides an layer of abstraction.
   3. It also reduces code redundancy as procedures and functions can be
      called instead of doing the same operations over and over again.


QUESTION 9)

Open two MySQL sessions. We call one of them A and the other one B.
Write START TRANSACTION; in both terminals.
a)In session A, add a new reservation.
b)Is this reservation visible in session B? Why? Why not?
c)What happens if you try to modify the reservation from A in B?
Explain what happens and why this happens and how this relates to the concept
of isolation of transactions.

a) OK result
b) NO it is not, because it has not been committed to the database yet.
c) It gets stuck waiting for  A to release the lock on the newly inserted
    reservation row. This relates to the concept of isolation of transactions
    in the way that it shows how different transactions cant modify the same data.
